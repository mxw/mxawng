There are a lot of things on the Internet and this is some of them.

## Notes ##

After my freshman year at Harvard, I decided to start live-TeXing notes for all
the courses I was taking that I cared to take notes in.  Here are the results
of these efforts:

- [Math 122][math122]: Algebra I
- [Math 123][math123]: Algebra II
- [Math 131][math131]: Topology I
- [Statistics 110][stat110]: Intro to Probability
- [Linguistics 107][ling107]: Intro to Indo-European&nbsp;
                              **<small>(UNFINISHED)</small>**

[math123]: notes/math123.pdf    "Math 123"
[math131]: notes/math131.pdf    "Math 131"
[stat110]: notes/stat110.pdf    "Stat 110"
[ling107]: notes/ling107.pdf    "Ling 107"


## Other Creations ##

I occasionally make things for my own amusement.

- [Reibar][reibar] is a program I originally wrote in CS 187---
  Computational Linguistics at Harvard, which attempts to generate X-bar syntax
  trees from arbitrary sentences.  It is a work in progress.

- I have done a bunch of arranging using Sibelius, and during this time I
  produced a [cheat sheet][sib-cs] for its keyboard shortcuts.
