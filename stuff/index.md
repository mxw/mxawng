## Notes ##

After my freshman year at Harvard, I decided to start live-TeXing notes for all
the courses I was taking that I cared to take notes in.  Here are the results
of these efforts:

- [Math 122][1]: Algebra I
- [Math 123][2]: Algebra II
- [Math 131][3]: Topology I
- [Statistics 110][4]: Intro to Probability
- [Linguistics 107][5]: Intro to Indo-European&nbsp;
