in 2013 i decided to make a personal website slash blog.  then i didn't really
touch it for a decade.

the previous site was [solarized][solarized]-themed and laid out as a carbon
copy of [a friend's site][avtok], from which i also inherited the write-once
access pattern.

this site's design is based on [these][cjq] [other][katmh] [sites][stammy] as
well as this [pair of shoes][insane-remix].  (if you ever find these shoes on
sale in EU size 45, please [contact me](/contact/)).

the two portraits on the [homepage](/) were painted by [my friend][feilin], and
the doodle was done by [another friend][jgriego] and former colleague.

i remade this website so i could create [this page](/things/wireeater/), and am
surprised to find that i've done so instead of just saying "coming soon!" for
nine years like i did on my old résumé page.

the source (and additional credits) for the site can be found [on github][gh].
