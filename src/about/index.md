hey, it's me, max.  what are the haps?

this is my personal website. i feel some ways about personal websites, like
that they are "pointless" or "not worth spending my time on".  but i also feel
that way about dressing myself sometimes and i still put on
[clothes](/things/unthings/).  or at least when i leave the apartment.

## currently

presently, i am trying to recover, heal, and do nothing.  i would like to
decouple my life and the living of it from the productivity grind that i've
spent it being conditioned for.  this is a remarkably difficult undertaking.

i read and occassionally [write poetry](/stuff/poetry/).  other stuff i do
includes vocal training, [making music](/stuff/music/), practicing house dance,
and [dance videography](/stuff/dance/#videography).  further down the
procrastination pipeline, i sometimes play [magic: the gathering][mtg] and
pokémon go.

## group identity

one of my core tenets is that my identity is something that resides wholly in
others' perceptions of me.  a corollary is that a major reservoir of who i am
is the groups i've been a part of.

another corollary is that here's a section on my website with my group
affiliations.

i'm used to describing myself as a "recent harvard grad", although this is no
longer accurate.  i went to school for english, took [math
classes](/stuff/#course-notes), decided to major in chemistry, and wound up
with a computer science degree.  i spent a lot of my time at harvard with the
[harvard university band][hub], and i [conducted][yAle] said band in my final
semesters.

after harvard, i ended up in the tech industry.  i spent my entire tenure on
facebook's [hhvm][hhvm] compiler team.  i have since [left fb][verge] for a new
career in vaguely doing art things and feeling bad about myself.

before all that, i attended the [center for talented youth][cty] over several
summers in lancaster, pa, where i [held the duck][duck].  i maintain
[RealCTY][realcty], the CTY wiki.

elsewhere in life, i help run [valor of boston][vob], which pre-pandemic was
one of boston's largest pokémon go communities.  i also danced with and
produced videos for MIT's [ADT][adt] though i have otherwise no affiliation
with MIT (unless the school up the river counts, which i suppose it could).
