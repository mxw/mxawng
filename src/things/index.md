this is where i put things that... aren't [stuff](/stuff/)?  the things that
aren't the stuff that i make.  the things out in the world.

if you've ever thought to yourself, "boy, i sure do trust max's taste in one or
more categories of things, and/or think his taste is terrible and aspire to its
antithesis," then do i have just the thing for you!  i have made a [bespoke
recommendations website](/things/wireeater/), which is subordinate to my
website in much the same way that a publication might be subordinate, say, to
the new york times or to vox media.

if you feel either of those ways about my taste in physical objects and
commercial goods in particular, please help me [dispossess](/things/unthings/)
myself of some things i no longer want.
