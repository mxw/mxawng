an oversized deck box for oversized decks and oversized cards.

this is no longer manufactured.  mine is out of packaging but unused.  i
realized shortly after buying it that more compact deck boxes existed which
could also hold some dice and sleeves, and i do not play commander because i am
not a filthy casual.
