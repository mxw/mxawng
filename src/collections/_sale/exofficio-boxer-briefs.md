never worn (except to try on).  i got these just before i discovered my
[favorite underwear](/things/wireeater/#brain:products), then kept them because
i'm dumb.  purportedly these are also quite moisture-wicking.

this underwear is a lot baggier around the dick than the smartwool merino,
which is very snug.  if you like that, or if you have an enormous dick and
balls, smash that buy button!
