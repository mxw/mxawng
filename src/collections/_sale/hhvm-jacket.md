brand new.  i love my former team and i still have all the swag, _however_, one
time our team admin ordered some jackets, the logo was missized too large by
the reseller, and we ended up with a bunch of extra jackets that i slowly gave
away to new teammates _except_ nobody took this one and it's too big for me.

now it can be yours!  the jacket is nice for spring and early fall and has a
cool outside texture (i have a size S).  the base product is a Stormtech
Performance Tactix MDJ-1.

former and current HHVM team members can have it for free.
