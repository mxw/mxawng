hiking pants, never worn.  here's the outdoorgearlab [review][review].  this
pair is the original production line (not the stretch zion ii), in charcoal
color.

like the review says, it's a spring/fall pant, probably too thicc for summer.
i have a well-fitting pair in men's 30 waist.  there is no good reason for why
i failed to return these.
