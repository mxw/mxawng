worn but clean and undamaged.

two-layer winter jacket with separable inner fleece and outer shell that can be
zipped together or worn individually.  outer shell has a detachable hood.

i have worn this during boston winters, but then one year i decided i wanted to
be able to survive while walking slowly for 12 hours playing pok√©mon go in
subzero temperatures in a blizzard.  i do not recommend this jacket for that
purpose, but it is good for most other winter purposes.
