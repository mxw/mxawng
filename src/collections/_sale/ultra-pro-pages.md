magic: the gathering card pocket pages that can in theory hold other cards i
guess.

Ultra Pro now only manufactures the cheaper one-sided toploader pages.  these
are much easier to use if you want to store cards in pages, which obviously i
no longer do.

i have ~4 sets of 50, one of which is unopened.
