durable ski gloves, never used.  they're well-reviewed but they don't fit my
hands right (they're snug but the palm is a bit too big and the fingers are a
bit too short).  i tried to break them in a bit indoors, but gave up and ran
out of time to return.

comes with all accessories (namely a couple leather treatment packets and a
carabiner).
