for almost a decade, i have been trying to find a copy of the perfect, most
luxurious santa hat that i once bought by chance at a shop in harvard square.

anyway please take away these failed attempts that i got on ebay.  turns out
most sellers will display a nice santa hat in their product image, but will
just ship some completely arbitrary santa hat.  as a santa hat connoisseur, i
cannot bring myself to wear these hats.
