very lightly worn.  six colors of shirts: black, white, green, wine, dark blue,
and less dark blue.  take them all for $20.  (the wine is XS but for some
reason is the same size as all the others.)

heavy fabric, loose-fit shirts.  i don't love the heft of the fabric but maybe
you do!  these tend to shrink in the dryer; i unshrank all the ones i dried and
no longer machine dry them.
