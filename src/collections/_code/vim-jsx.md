a li'l Vimscript package i whipped up over the weekend as a facebook intern.
as i understand it, it remained the vim bundle of choice for JSX for years
until it fell into disrepair, since during all that time i had never written a
line of JSX not solely to test syntax highlighting.  probably my most useful
open source contribution, even though it's deprecated.  not all software needs
to last forever.
