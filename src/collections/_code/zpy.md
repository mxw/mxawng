i made [ZPY][zpy-gh], a so-called "pandemic project", so i could play tractor
with my friends and/or learn UI dev.  later it turned out i didn't have many
friends who played tractor.  it also turned out someone else was implementing a
tractor, but their implementation did not have the aesthetic delight that comes
with using the [messenger v1 emoji set][emoji] as iconography.
