look, if you have a penis and you enjoy comfort, you should really at least try
this underwear.  i know it costs a million dollars but it's so odor-resistent
you really don't need that many pairs to cycle through and idk what else to
say, it's the best purchase i've ever made that isn't some massive piece of
equipment like a computer or a piano.

backcountry has significant discounts on them twice a year or so if, uh, you
can tolerate a high price for underwear but not _quite_ as high as it is
normally.  the pictured "sea blue" color seems to be out of production, though,
but they are my favorite and kinda match my site theme and if you ever see them
for sale anywhere, [you know how to contact me](/contact/).
