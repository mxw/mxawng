if you've eyeballed my [about](/about/) page, know me irl, or have
[interacted](/contact/) with me and thought about it, you probably won't be
surprised when i say that i consider my primary artistry to be my performance
of my self.

what does that mean?  well, you can watch this instructional video to learn
more!

i am in fact a wholly aesthetics-driven person and pretty much all my beliefs,
ethics, and interests are just aesthetic taste if you look under the hood.
this video just _speaks_ to me, and it is my favorite video, my favorite essay,
and hence also my favorite... huh what do you call those again
