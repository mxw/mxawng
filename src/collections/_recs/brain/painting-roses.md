if i had to pick an overall favorite song, "painting roses" by the defunct band
dresses would be it.

folksy indie songwriting has been at the heart of my regular listening
aesthetic ever since high school, when a friend of mine, jess, made me a six-CD
mix of music she thought was worth hearing.  the contents ranged from purple
rain to [back when i was 4][bwiw4] and, well, i guess we know which one stuck
with me longer.  (before she gave me this mix, i simply only listened to anime
soundtracks.)
