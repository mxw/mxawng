hadestown is my favorite musical.  more folksy and soulful than theatrical,
it's a sung-through masterpiece of songwriting.  also i cried every time i
watched the story end.

not to be a fuckin' hipster, but imo the broadway version of the show is... not
great.  for me, what made the show such a vital evolution of the [concept
album][ca] were the chants and the further development of the epics.  in the
NYTW and NT versions of the show, chant ii and epic iii in particular manage to
portray the varied complexity of relationship conflicts, and then draw a
narrative parallel between the troubles of the gods and those of orpheus and
eurydice.  what results is a timeless (and authentically greek myth!) sense of
relatability---love is hard, trying, laborious, and ultimately, rejuvenating,
for gods, men, and the earth alike.

in the broadway version, all of this is cut in favor of what's essentially a
milktoast "when a MAN loves a WOMAN" delivered weakly by reeve.  having heard
any previous versions of the show, this feels hugely anticlimactic and
antidramatic.

uh... but anyway.  my favorite pieces across the show's history are the concept
album [<mark>wedding song</mark>][wedding], and [<mark>chant ii</mark>][chant]
and [<mark>epic iii</mark>][epic] from... the NT version, but the only official
recordings are of NYTW, and those are great too.  i also really like [<mark>how
long?</mark>][how-long], which was left basically untouched since the concept
album (and thank the gods for that).
