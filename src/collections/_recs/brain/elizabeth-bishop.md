i love liz bishop in great part because peter sacks, who i took two-and-a-half
poetry classes with, loved liz bishop.

these classes, all of which centered bishop at some point, gave me a better
understanding of the relationship between author and art-object, and in
particular a better understanding of my own relationship with representation
and with self-representation.  the delicateness with which bishop investigates
every portrayal and how it also portrays herself has changed the way i write,
to be at once more decisive and more orbital.

art is fraught work, in which the same precision we use to represent a subject
also _captures_ that subject, and also ourselves (if, in representation, it's
even possible to make such a distinction).

on a lighter note, peter sacks also taught me the word "[poiesis][poiesis]",
which i now use all over in the privacy of my own digital organization systems.

my favorite of bishop's poems is the very last one she published during her
lifetime,  <mark>five flights up</mark>, which you can read [here][ffu].
