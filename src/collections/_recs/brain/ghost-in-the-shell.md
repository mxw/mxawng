before the live action flop starring scarlett johansson, before a laundry list
of ill-received sequels, ghost in the shell was just a manga, a movie
adaptation, and an original-story, two-season anime.

that anime was and still is the most formative work of fiction in my life.  it
made me more anti-authoritarian and skeptical in my political imagination.  it
pushed me to think more deeply about what exactly characterizes human sapience
that underlies my values.  it presented such a range of individual motivations
that it surely expanded my theory of mind at the time.  and it ultimately
defined my one true dream in life---the sort of unbounded, interhuman
connectedness that hideo kuze wanted to facilitate, or to symbolize, or to
simply become.

aesthetically, it also invents a vision of the future that's at once visually
thrilling, optimistic, and unsettling, and the animation is fluid, blocked well
and surprisingly soulful.

i like the dub for this one because i think the voice acting interprets the
tone of the show thoughtfully---togusa's journalistic recounting, batou's
confident and impassioned introspectiveness, and aramaki's... idk, but his
voice matches his hair.  both <mark>ghost in the shell: stand alone

available to watch for free on adult swim, linked above.
