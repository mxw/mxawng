hanon has displaced yume ga arukara in cambridge as my favorite udon in the US.
they have a great variety of preparations, but i love curry noodles so my go-to
is the <mark>washu-gyu curry udon</mark>.  their cold udons are tasty, but the
serving sizes are smaller and they end up much less satisfying to dig into for
me.

hanon closed for a while in 2022 due to a building fire, so show them some
love when they reopen!
