one time, a friend i'd then just met on hinge invited me to get dinner at le
sia, and she (a chinese international) deemed me to have good, authentic taste
when i ordered the <mark>疙瘩汤 (dough drop soup)</mark>.

contrarily, i think my preference for <mark>鸡肉串 (chicken skewers)</mark>
over lamb raised a bit of an eyebrow.  but growing up, there was a whole decade
where, whenever i'd visit family in beijing, chicken skewers from street
vendors was all i'd eat outside of my mom's cooking.  le sia nails its beijing
flavors---and to be honest, in {{ 'now' | date: "%Y" }}, it pretty much nails
the beijing prices, too.

i go to le sia for beijing food every few days whenever i'm in new york (and
even more if i'm dancing at BDC, since it's literally around the corner).  if
you need a third dish in your rotation, i like the soupy
<mark>金针菇肥牛</mark> as well---a dish i have my friend to thank for
introducing me to.
