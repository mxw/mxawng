i wouldn't know that murray hill existed if it did not contain my favorite
shanghaiese restaurant.  nowhere else have i gotten chinese flavors as clean as
i do at little alley at an affordable price point.  the <mark>eight delicacies
in chili sauce</mark> in particular is just so pointedly málà with such a mild,
low-profile heat, i feel like i'm tasting málà for the first time every time i
order it.  i also enjoy the <mark>上海粗炒面 (shanghai stir-fried thick
noodles)</mark>.

their prices tend to be quite a bit higher on delivery apps (unless they've
just increased across the board by 25% since i was last there...), so i always
prefer to stop in.
