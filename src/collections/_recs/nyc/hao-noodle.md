i don't have much to say about hao noodle.  i've only been to the chelsea
location, and while i've tried a few things on the menu, the only thing i
remember is the <mark>hotpot beef noodle soup</mark>.  it's the best spicy beef
noodle soup i've had in the US (or anywhere, i guess; it's not something i've
looked for in china).  compared to all the watery,
unseasoned-save-for-some-chili-oil "broths" out there, i guess it's not a high
bar to cross, but hao noodle's take sets a strong standard.
