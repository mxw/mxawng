    title: hot & sour hand-pulled noodles from gene's

gene's is a huge part of why, despite a concerted search effort in cities like
NYC and LA, i still like boston best for noodles.  in LA there are places like
[shaanxi garden][shaanxi] and [bang bang noodles][bangbang], and in NYC
there's... uh.  there's xi'an famous foods?  ok oof.

so anyway those LA shops are great, but at the end of the day, for hand-pulled,
hand-torn noodles with good chew and chonk, i just wanna go back to gene's.
the noodles are incredibly consistent and have the perfect bite and thickness
(a.k.a. thicc af), and i think gene stretches his prices at least as much as
his noodles (ü•Åü•Åüí•) because it's honestly hard to find a cheaper meal in the
area.

the noodles are the centerpiece of almost every dish on the menu, so it's hard
to go wrong.  i now exclusively order the #16 <mark>hot & sour hand-pulled
noodle soup</mark>, a strongly-seasoned and very vinegar-forward soup that also
contains an entire pig's worth of pork.  the only caveat: the take-out bowls
are filled to the brim, so if you're transporting them, make sure they're
stable.  i often pick up my gene's order on bike, and more than a few times
i've ended up with bag soup.  (i just pour it back into the bowl and it's just
as tasty.)

i am not clear on why "flatbread" is in the name, because even if it refers to
ËÇâÂ§πÈ¶ç, that is absolutely a sandwich and not a pizza.
