the first time i had <mark>pho</mark> was at le's in harvard square while i was
a student.  it was great, but surely, i thought, not the best i could find?

since then, i've had the "best pho in the city" as recommended by friends (or
occasionally by the internet) in the bay area, philly, los angeles, and nyc.
they were all... just awful?  not for lack of trying, i've found le's to be---

well okay.  the best bowl of pho i've had was in the facebook boston kitchen
under chef barry maiden and a vietnamese sous chef.  the next best was probably
at [pure kitchen and bar][pure] in calgary, which, technically, is not in this
country at all.  and i've had a few upscale phos at 2x the typical price which
aren't even worth mentioning; they were all nice but unremarkable.

so maybe one day i'll find a truly jaw-dropping pho.  until that day, i think
i'll go back to le's.
