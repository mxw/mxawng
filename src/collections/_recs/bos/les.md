the first time i had <mark>pho</mark> was at le's in harvard square while i was
a student.  by my senior year, i'd be getting it as take-out at least once a
week.

since then, i've had the "best pho in the city" as recommended by friends (or
occasionally by the internet) in the bay area, philly, los angeles, and nyc,
looking for an even better bowl.  and they were all... just awful?  so not for
lack of trying, i've found le's to be---

well okay.  the best bowl of pho i've had was in the facebook boston kitchen
under chef barry maiden and a vietnamese sous chef.  the next best was probably
at [pure kitchen and bar][pure] in calgary, which is a teeeeny bit out of the
way.  and i've had a few upscale phos at 2x the typical price which aren't even
worth identifying; they were all nice but unremarkable.

so maybe one day i'll find a truly jaw-dropping pho.  until that day, it really
is back to my college town and le's.
