for ramenheads, ramen chefs, and bostonian food eaters, yume needs no
introduction.  for everyone else: yume is a dream workshop.  you go in, you
think for a bit, and you share a dream you aim to achieve.  i usually look
towards the next few weeks or months, which is not something i'm prone to doing
normally.

while you think, you can eat a huge bowl of ramen.  yume's ramen is unique---in
style, sure, but even more so in attention to detail.  i've gone to yume
sometimes sporadically and sometimes regularly, but at least once a year since
it opened in 2012.  the founder, tsuyoshi-san, passed on ownership a few years
ago, and especially in the last couple years, former apprentice jake has really
been improving his craft.

i can't say i remember just how yume ramen tasted ten years ago compared to
today, except that it was delicious.  but i know that it's still improving, and
it's easily the best in town today (and currently it's the only boston-area
ramen i really like).

the recent changes that stand out to me: the chashu has gotten a lot better in
both texture and flavor; and something about the balance of the dish has made
it easier for me to eat more frequently, whereas before the sheer density made
it a monthly-or-less kind of meal.

if you go, get, uh, the <mark>ramen</mark>, which is the only thing you can get.
