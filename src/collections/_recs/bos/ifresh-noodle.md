have i mentioned i like noodles?

this place has existed since 2016?  and i only heard about it (from jake, ramen
chef at yume) in 2020?  honestly devastating news.

a shaanxi noodle rival to gene's is a delicious contribution to boston's
noodlescape.  ifresh has my current favorite <mark>凉皮</mark> in the country
and i've also enjoyed their <mark>spicy oil biang biang noodles</mark>.  it has
a rounder flavor compared to some of the aggressively vinegary or garlicky
gene's plates, and the noodles are more elastic and less thiiicc.  having
access to this contrast is a small luxury, and i could happily alternate ifresh
and gene's for lunch every day without tiring of either.
