i had cha bei bei for the first time in early 2020, and tbh it's ruined all
other boba for me.  the owner tonie makes all her boba by hand, entirely from
scratch---just tapioca, water, and a starchy vegetable for color and texture,
not hydrated from a powder mix like most "homemade" boba.  she uses
custom-balanced blends of imported leaf teas assembled with care, with even the
ice cubes made of frozen tea.  the milk teas are served with cream for extra
richness, or with a homemade nut milk for the dairy-averse.

i'm not a regular!tea drinker, but drinking tonie's teas has given me a better
understanding of what quality tea can taste like and how it can stand up to all
the sugary flavors in a bubble tea.  by comparison, every other boba shop might
as well be serving muddy water with trash balls.

if the michelin guide visited boba shops, cha bei bei would have the only
stars.  as far as i'm concerned, it's _the_ reason to go to the LA area.

get the <mark>house milk tea with boba</mark>, no alterations.  then get
anything else on the menu---i like the thai milk tea, and the mangonada when
it's in season.
