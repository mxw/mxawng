theoretically this is a tortas shop, but i couldn't stop myself from just
ordering the <mark>pozole</mark> every time because i love soups and stews.  i
suspect better pozoles can be had in the kitchens of various abuelas but those
are not places i have access to.

i also really enjoyed the <mark>fish tacos</mark> which were unlike any fish
tacos i've ever had before.  both the breading and the onion-tomato salsa were
a bright red-orange color and they tasted surreal against the endless backdrop
of baja fish tacos.
