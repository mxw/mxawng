this tamale truck is on every list of tamales in LA and it's the real deal.
the tamales are more moist and tender than any other tamale i've had---maybe
because they're wrapped relatively small---and also the most consistently
flavorful.  my favorite savory option is the <mark>pork tamale</mark>.

every order comes with salsa rojo and salsa verde in little baggies.  the rojo
is, i think, habanero based, and was way too hot for me (especially in the
summer heat).  the jalapeno and cilantro <mark>salsa verde</mark> was perfect.

when i was in town, the little restaurant had shut down but the food truck was
running.  it's open until it sells out, which was around 11 a.m. on weekdays
and 12.30 p.m. on weekends.
