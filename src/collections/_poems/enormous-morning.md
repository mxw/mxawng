stone-taut—awaken  
to iron sunlight, streaming through each slat.  
slashed into ribbons, they can wrap you,  
buried in down,  
anointed by silence,  
by the empty hum of it

who lies here?  which  
principle or sentiment,  
tension or intention, was moored here  
to this place of rest?

a sea of cotton quivers; a dim eye  
floods with frozen mockeries  
or memories worth their weight  
in silver coin.  
who will carry you?—  
across the surges  
of frenzied sight; the swells  
of ruins, of the unwatched pieces  
of some body, unwitnessed,  
tearful, rent—  
and into solace
