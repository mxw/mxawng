here beneath the cobblestone sky,  
&emsp;&emsp;moths alight like dancing embers:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;swirling, spiraling, they find  
their funeral pyre—urgently,  
&emsp;&emsp;imparting every pulse with splendorous  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;fire, free, the moths aspire,  
heart and wing-beat intertwined  
&emsp;&emsp;in metabolic revelry.

captivated, you may wish to wait,  
&emsp;&emsp;watching while the wavering air  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;encircles you, tiptoeing toward  
that brilliant view; or consecrate  
&emsp;&emsp;their motion, reaching out with wary  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;fingertips—as through them slip  
those fireflies—slip through the door,  
&emsp;&emsp;upstairs, and past, into the night.
