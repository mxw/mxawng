here beneath the cobblestone sky,  
moths alight like dancing embers:  
swirling, spiraling, they find  
their funeral pyre—urgently,  
imparting every pulse with splendorous  
fire, free, the moths aspire,  
heart and wing-beat intertwined  
in metabolic revelry.

captive, you might wish to wait,  
watching while the wavering air  
encircles you, tiptoeing toward  
that brilliant view; or consecrate  
their motion, reaching out with wary  
fingertips—as through them slip  
those fireflies—slip through the door,  
upstairs, and past, into the night.
