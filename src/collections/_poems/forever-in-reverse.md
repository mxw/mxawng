you could find a clearing—  
there, beneath the silver marshes,  
steeped bright copper in the sleepy light  
of suppertime, a curious shroud  
over eyelids barely shut. it is quiet  
in these slow minutes before nightfall.

a little berry bush grows there,  
green fractals bursting from green, brilliant  
as any sun-ray, collecting all the signs  
of afternoon. pluck any fruit from it  
and fold it in your palm, trace  
in all dimensions with your fingertips  
—and know it is called love.
