Flesh is made of madness; it decomposes  
as microscopic mania, a trembling cacophony  
of possibilities, inked out in some inscrutable cartography:  
this is the chart that every birth composes.  
Its orientation's unknown. Each fading, shallow stroke implies  
a start of questions, like the kindly wayside signs  
instructing how to turn into or along these lines—  
or perhaps the moss-hewn bed where realization lies.

How does a person weather this life? Are they like a boulder,  
landmarked, unflappable, against a crying dawn wind,  
bits of self scraped off in secret, refusing to move even one inch  
but for the arrogant rain of time? The boulder would rather die  
than change, so again and again it dies and dies  
its unseen deaths; it sinks deeply into its earth, clutches dirt,  
bleeds hot magma from a crackling heart, fills up  
its skin-dry scars with easy moss. This is a boulder. Do you think  
the boulder bits find each other again and make  
a great monument, a great memory,  
a great tomb for the boulder? Nothing is so abject,  
so unbecoming as becoming.

Few lives are lived. Most are mislaid,  
as if marooned someplace between the is and land,  
latent, as if being were too slight or still, and  
its trembling blue dot marks where our bodies are laid.  
Yet, I think every life ought to transpire. Each foregone,  
unprinted trail, each unmade desire, each wish is a tragedy;  
therefore—in what is—there is only majesty.  
Look back just once, and even the road is gone.
