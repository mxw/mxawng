Flesh is made of madness; it decomposes  
as microscopic mania, a trembling cacophony  
of possibilities, inked out in some inscrutable cartography:  
this is the chart that every birth composes.  
The orientation's unknown. Each perfect, shallow stroke belies  
contingency, while squarish road-side signs  
instruct how to turn or tilt along these lines  
to some shady bed, where realization lies.

How does a person travail this life? Are they like a boulder,  
landmarked, unflappable, against a desperate dawn wind,  
bits of self scraped off in secret, refusing to move even an inch  
but for the arrogant rain of time? A boulder would rather die,  
so again and again it dies and dies  
familiar deaths: it seeps into its earth, clutches dirt,  
bleeds hot magma from a quivering heart, fills up  
its skin-dry scars with easy moss. This is a boulder. Do you think  
the boulder bits find each other again and make  
a great monument, a great memory,  
a great tomb for the boulder? Nothing is so abject,  
so unbecoming as becoming.

Few lives are lived. Most are mislaid,  
as if marooned someplace between the is and land,  
latent, as if being were too slight or still, and  
its trembling blue dot marked where our bodies are laid.  
Yet, I think every life ought to transpire: each foregone  
trail, each unworn desire, each wish is a tragedy;  
therefore, in what isâ€”there is only majesty.  
Look back just once, and even the road is gone.
