trying to remember  
biking down Massachusetts Avenue:

behind, a pair of old furnaces take their turns breathing.  
hunched, reliable, they alternate gasps  
or yawns in their regular exchange of habit.  
their hum coats a dim metal dust, the worker's glove,  
velveteen grit adorning fingertips; it is  
the ringing in your ears which neither starts  
nor stops. does anyone notice that they're there?  
tucked in unremarkably, like bricks shaken loose  
by decades of boredom—can the passers-by  
stop in their tracks and feel release,  
the satisfaction of a quiet ending to each day?

further along, here the empty buildings seem to offer  
their own suggestions, in big whispering echoes,  
stringing their crumpled edicts out onto a wiry wind.  
they tower aloof overhead, insistent,  
—their back alleys tower, too, in imitation,  
decked in agitated signage, in all caps, as if to say:  
it is impossible.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;
                    and the wind  
which makes no true sound at all,  
it carries the city like an obviously unwanted passenger.  
someone steps outside of a shop; maybe they make a noise.  
just beneath, i hear a trickle: cool, clear.

i bend down, turning my ear towards the sidewalk's edge.  
there the river meets the night.  
it weaves the bright wispy steam of the moon  
snug along its modest, bankless body,  
like a glacial flow carrying the final sediment  
of its age to the unknown basin. i remember  
that it must have snowed the other day,  
and then the wind flutters wild and chilly  
like a swarm; but the river is so close  
—it has nowhere to go, and by tomorrow,  
maybe, it will be gone. i record the sound:  
fresh crackling, intensely delicate, the sound  
of invisibility, each droplet its own dream, each  
a chorus of downpour, still the river carries itself from here  
and gulps down into the crack beneath the sidewalk:  
and when i listen back, i understand  
that all i may hear is the wind.
