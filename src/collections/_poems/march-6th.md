trying to remember  
biking down Massachusetts Avenue:

behind, a pair of old furnaces take their turns breathing.  
hunched, reliable, they alternate gasps  
or yawns in their steady exchange of habit.  
their hum is a dim metal dust, the worker's glove,  
velveteen grit adorning fingertips; and  
the ringing in your ears which neither starts  
nor stops. does anyone notice that they're here?  
tucked in unremarkably, like bricks shaken loose  
by decades of boredom—can the passers-by  
stop in their tracks and feel release,  
the satisfaction of a quiet ending to each day?

further along, here the buildings also seem to speak.  
they hiss and they whisper and string their  
crumpled secrets out onto a wiry wind.  
they tower indifferently, faking stillness  
—their back alleys tower, too,  
dressed in agitated signage, in all caps, as if to say:  
it is impossible.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;
                    and the wind  
which makes no true sound at all,  
it carries the city like an obviously unwanted passenger.  
someone steps outside of a shop; maybe they make a noise.  
just beneath, i hear a trickle: cool, clear.

i bend down, turning my ear towards the sidewalk's edge.  
there the river meets the night.  
it weaves the wispy steam of the moon  
snug along its modest, bankless body,  
like a glacial flow carrying the final sediment  
of its age to the unknown basin. i remember  
that it must have snowed the other day,  
and then the wind flutters wild and chilly  
like a swarm; but the river is so close  
—it has nowhere to go, and by tomorrow,  
maybe, it will be gone. i record the sound:  
fresh crackling, intensely delicate, the sound  
of invisibility, each droplet its own dream, each  
a chorus of downpour, still the river carries itself from here  
and gulps down into the crack beneath the sidewalk:  
and when i listen back, i understand  
that all i may hear is the wind.
