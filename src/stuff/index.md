there is a lot of content on the internet and this is some of it.

## course notes

after my freshman year at harvard, i decided to start live-TeXing notes for
all the courses i was taking that i wanted to take notes for.  here are the
results of these efforts:

- [Math 122][math122]: Algebra I
- [Math 123][math123]: Algebra II
- [Math 131][math131]: Topology I
- [Stat 110][stat110]: Intro to Probability
- [Ling 107][ling107]: Intro to Indo-European

[math122]: notes/math122.pdf  "Math 122"
[math123]: notes/math123.pdf  "Math 123"
[math131]: notes/math131.pdf  "Math 131"
[stat110]: notes/stat110.pdf  "Stat 110"
[ling107]: notes/ling107.pdf  "Ling 107"


## other creations

i sometimes write [code](/stuff/code/), create [music](/stuff/music/), or
perform [dance](/stuff/dance/) in a way that is minimally presentable to an
audience.  personally, i do not consume any content until it is vetted by one
million internet likes.  but you could make a different choice.

i also write and i like my writing.  check out some of my [screeds](/writing/)
and [poetry](/writing/poetry/).
