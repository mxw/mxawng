i enjoy writing music for others to perform.  sadly this is the most
inconvenient relationship with music to have as an amateur who does not attend
a school.

to compensate for this personality defect, i've been trying to pick up
electronic composition and improve my mediocre performance skills.

anyway here's some stuff.

## practice

two pieces i'm proud of from an electronic music class i took at MIT (21M.361),
both using recorded sound as the source material:

a video of me dressed as a frog singing a frog song after the first few months
of regular vocal training:

## supplement

i have done a bunch of arranging and transcribing using Sibelius, and during
this time i produced a [cheat sheet for its keyboard shortcuts][sib-cs].

## trivia

in increasing order of incompetency, my instruments are: voice, alto saxophone,
piano, and ukulele.

in 2007, i attended the late george parks's [drum major academy][dma] in west
chester, pa, during which i won a march-off.  this is without question the
crowning music-related achievement of my life.
