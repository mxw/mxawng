i picked up dance as a craft after an ex-girlfriend cheated on me (putting it
alongside other skills, like baking or [playing this song on the ukulele][uke],
that i also gained after being cheated on by ex-girlfriends).  nowadays i
mostly dance house, some hip-hop, and very little choreo.

unlike most other things i do, there's basically no records of my dance
practice that i'm willing to subject my website viewers to.

## videography

i also **film dance** and _am_ willing to subject a wider audience to some of
my edits.  (if for some reason you want me to film for you, you can try
[contacting me](/contact/).)
