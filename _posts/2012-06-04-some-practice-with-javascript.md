title: Some practice with Javascript

Before heading into my second Facebook internship, which will be my first
attempt at doing any sort of web programming, I decided to teach myself some
Javascript.  This is actually the third time I've decided to "learn
Javascript", but having nothing in mind to make with it after the first two
attempts, all I achieved was a pleasant and nostalgic sense of familiarity
whenever I looked over Mozilla's JS references.

[Carl](http://avtok.com) suggested that I duplicate a js1k submission, so
here's my simplified clone of [this pong game](http://js1k.com/2010-first/demo/41)
from the first js1k---simplified in the sense that it is less flashy.  It is,
of course, many more bytes.
