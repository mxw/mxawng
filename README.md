this is my personal website, powered by jekyll, and housed on github for
personal convenience.  a few credits:

- [octopress][1] was the initial template for the directory structure,
  stylesheets, and plugins, though i think little that would be recognizable
  remains.
- [compass][2] inspired the vertical rhythm utilities.
- [this medium post][3] gave me the webpack -> jekyll pipeline.
- i used [favicon.io][4] to generate all my icon variants.
- the simple static resource versioning idea is from [here][5].

other accreditation can be found inline in the source and on the about page for
the [site itself](https://mxawng.com/about/site/).
