this is my personal website, powered by jekyll, and housed on github for
personal convenience.

- [octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress) was the initial template
  for the directory structure, stylesheets, and plugins, though i think little
  that would be recognizable remains.
- [compass](http://compass-style.org/) inspired the vertical rhythm utilities.

other accreditation can be found inline in the source and on the about page for
the [site itself](https://mxawng.com/about/site/).
