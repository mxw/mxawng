This is my personal website, powered by Jekyll, and housed on GitHub for
personal convenience.

I'm using vanilla Jekyll with no additional frameworks to try to learn a thing
or two about web design.  Naturally, this is not a solitary process.  Aspects
of my site's design have been influenced by:

- [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) provides the colorscheme.
- [Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress) was the basis for the
  directory organization.  Some stylesheets were initially based on Octopress
  stylesheets, though the resemblance now is faint.  Some Octopress plugins
  have also been borrowed.
- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) inspired the vertical rhythm utilities.
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is used minimally in some places.

Other accreditation can be found inline in the source.
