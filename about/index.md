My name is Max Wang, and this is a blog about me and some of the things I think
about that I also happen to write down.  If you were looking to find posts
about some subject in particular, you'll probably be disappointed unless that
subject you had in mind was the stuff in my brain.

There's some okay stuff in there, though.

## Bio ##

I'm a recent graduate of Harvard with a degree in computer science.  While not
coding or reading CS papers (or just chilling, which I'm sure I did more of), I
also studied mathematics, linguistics, and chemistry---in roughly descending
order of diligence---and I continue to do all these things regularly, though
not generally all at the same time.  I also enjoy writing (mostly exposition
and autobiographical fiction), and I'm a musician, with some degree of
competency in classical sax, some degree of incomptency in piano, and some
degree of ownership of an acoustic guitar.

I am a proud alum of the [Center for Talented Youth][1] and am the maintainer
of [RealCTY][2], the CTY wiki; I also held the [Duck][3] there.  I was a member
of the [Harvard University Band][4] in all my four years at Harvard and
conducted the Band in my final semesters.

I hoard my own data and have kept all the schoolwork I've produced since middle
school (and much of it from earlier) organized into collections of binders,
bins, and hard drives---so I suppose it's impressive that I've never worked at
Google.  I like playing board games, but, probably like most people, I spend
more time chatting with friends or poking the Internet, and I'm just totally
okay with that.  My other interests include orange juice, apple juice, metal
clipboards, stuffed animals, and speaking with a loud voice.

If given the choice, I'd choose this life to live again every time.
