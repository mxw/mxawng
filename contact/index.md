If you'd like to communicate with me online, you can reach me at \[my
second-level domain\] @ <img id="gmail-icon" src="/img/icons/gmail.png"/>.

I exist elsewhere on the Internet as well, as __mxw__ or __mxawng__.

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
<li class="li-icon facebook">
  Friend me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mxw">Facebook</a> if we are
  friends!  But probably not if we aren't?
</li>
<li class="li-icon twitter">
  I have a <a href="https://twitter.com/mxawng">Twitter</a>.  One true fact
  about my Twitter is that it doesn't have <i>no</i> tweets.
</li>
<li class="li-icon github">
  My navbar suggests that I have a <a href="https://github.com/mxw">GitHub</a>
  for code probably, which as it turns out is the case.
</li>
</ul>
